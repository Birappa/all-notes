=======================Spring Core===================
- spring conatainers - BeanFactory and ApplicationContext

-ApplicationContext is built top of BeanFactory and having more enterprise features.

==========Inversion of control=======
-we don't create object.
-object shall be configured in xml file and created by spring conatiner.
- Control of object is given to spring conatainer.
- complete life cycle of object is managed by container. creation, destroy, etc.

======================Dependency Injection===================
- it reduces the complexity of programming code.
- it makes programming loosely coupled.
- it searches dependency and inject object using container.
- using dependency injection inversion of control is achieved.
 
  


======================Array vs vector==========================
Vector is dynamically growth, they resizable in nature
vector is syncronized


============Comparable vs Comparator==============
Comparable is  used to compare instances of its own classes where comparator is used to compare two different objects.

comparable is single sorting sequence means only one property can use for compare like id, name or salary.
Where as comparator is multiple sorting sequence means can use multiple variable to compare like id , name.
